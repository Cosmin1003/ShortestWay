# Shortest Path Finder

A Java implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. This project demonstrates efficient pathfinding using priority queues and graph traversal techniques.

## Features

- Implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
- Graph representation using nodes and arcs
- Priority queue-based optimization
- Efficient path reconstruction
- Clean, object-oriented design

## Project Structure

- `src/Dijkstra.java` - Main implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
- `src/Graph.java` - Graph data structure
- `src/Node.java` - Node representation
- `src/Arc.java` - Arc/Edge representation

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven (for dependency management)

## Usage

The project can be used to find the shortest path between any two nodes in a graph. The implementation is optimized for performance and can handle large graphs efficiently.
